For example, if Candidate A receives 53% of the votes, and Candidate B receives 47% of the votes, the difference will be found by subtracting 47 from 53, thus the margin of victory in this case would equal 6 (|Candidate A% - Candidate B%| = Margin of Victory).  Determination of the margin of victory of this election will be based on official information from the Yüksek Seçim Kurulu/YSK/Supreme Election Council (e.g. https://www.ysk.gov.tr/tr/cumhurbaskani-secim-arsivi/2647).
